- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hellomattnewman
- I'm a data translator getting my MSBA at UVA's Darden/McIntire Schools
- I like to use data to help people gain a deeper understanding the world around them and the choices they make in it.
- I'm interested in telling more compelling stories by using data with both inferential statistics and machine learning techniques.
- I'm also a hobbyist maker and use Arduino and other code-driven tools in my projects from time to time.
- More detail on me and my work at hellomattnewman.com
